/**
 * CoMD: A Molecular Dynamics proxy applications suite
 *
 * CoMD is designed to be an extensible molecular dynamics
 * proxy applications suite.  The idea is that we will
 * capture the essense of different features of molecular
 * dynamics in this software and extend it to multiple
 * platforms.  The code will serve as a vehicle for co-design
 * by allowing others to extend it as needed to get better
 * performance on different architectures.
 *
 * -# A good introduction to molecular dynamics can be found
 *   in "Computer simulation of liquids" by M.P. Allen and
 *   D.J. Tildesley.
 *   ISBN-10: 0198556454 | ISBN-13: 978-0198556459
 * -# A description of how to run MD at large scales can be
 *   found in "369 Tflop/s molecular dynamics simulations
 *   on the Roadrunner general-purpose heterogeneous
 *   supercomputer" by S. Swaminarayan, K. Kadau, T.C. Germann,
 *   and G. Fossum published in Proceedings of SC'08.
 *
 * Our code allows the user to use either the Lennard-Jones
 * potential or the Embedded Atom Method Potential.  Both these
 * are discussed in #2 above.
